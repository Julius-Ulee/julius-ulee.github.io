Weather is the state of air in the atmosphere at a certain time and place that is erratic and changing. Assessment of weather categories is generally expressed by taking into account rain conditions, air temperature, amount of cloud cover, evaporation, humidity, and wind speed in a place from day to day.

This [Daily Weather Report](https://github.com/Julius-Ulee/Daily-Weather-Report) was created to find out in detail about the current weather and the purpose of this project is made for learning media only.
