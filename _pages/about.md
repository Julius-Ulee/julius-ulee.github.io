I was born and raised in [Jakarta](https://goo.gl/maps/Ht178nYrYi4pYYDN8). Jakarta is located in the province of West Java, Indonesia, and is famous for its rich history, including as the capital of Sunda Kalapa and being the port center of the Padjadjaran kingdom. I look forward to seeing you in my hometown.
